                        <p>Class 7 is a group of funny monkeys. Of course, you can see the most creative monkeys here. But do you know the other side of this group? The “Couple Culture” is become more and more famous. Today, more and more couples are appearing. Let us find out all of them.
                It is a long history. At the beginning of the first term (2019/9), everyone didn’t know each other very much, so no one came out and became the first couple. But things changed in 2 months. Some students seemed to enjoy looking for couples, and there were lots of among us. The first couple appeared in 3 months, and the second couple appeared in 2021.</p><p>
                
                All in all, the first term wasn’t very exciting. At the end of this term, there were still 2 couples. However, things weren’t always the same. The third term, more amazing couples appeared. I’ll tell them one by one.</p>
                
                <h2>First couple: The oldest one in Class 7, become a symbol of “Couple Culture”</h2><p>
                
                  They don't look friendly at all, but in fact, they are the world sweetest, aren’t they? Check here: https://www.google.com.hk/search?q=what+is+a+symbol+of+couples.Then you can find that every rule on the website they followed! </p><p>
                
                Their relationships started in 2020. In this special year, they hung out, used the same thing, talk with each other daily… Wu even touched Li’s head and Li didn’t turn down!</p><p>
                
                When it was the time on sports meeting of grade 7, Wu wrote a love letter to Li. The main idea of the letter is “I ****”. Then this letter spread the word in our class, almost everyone knows that Wu really loved Li. Her best friends like Zhang, Chen, become extra people between their personal lives.</p><p>
                
                Their relationships are not only on sports meeting, but also in studying. In the first term, Wu wasn’t very good. However, Li did very well in studying. Then Wu studied hard, His marks became better and better, almost reached Li. The final exam for this school term, we could see that Li didn’t get a good mark. People from "Golden Triangle" inferred that Li was deliberate to make sure Wu could catch her.
                In the future, Wu will probably marry Li, they could live together and have happiness lives. At that time, everyone will celebrate them on a wonderful wedding party!</p><p>

                <h2>something is hidden</h2><p>something is hidden. There were at least 600 words here. However, they were hidden by the stupid writer 
                </p>
                
                <h2>Third couple: Actually the sweetest couple I’ve ever seen, made another legend</h2><p>
                
                  At first, they were strangers, and truly didn’t know they could come together. As you see, now they are talking, walking, reading, do almost anything together. They are also the sweetest couple in our class. But how can they get together? It was another long history…</p><p>
                
                  An autumn night, the classroom was full of noise. Before the scene got out of hand, Shen tried his best to make everyone calm down, then Li did the daily summary. When she was reading the final sentence, everyone was surprised: Shen did something “not so good” with Zhang (What kind of things, everyone knows). And the classroom was full of noise again, everyone shouted and said “Oh~”. THEN THIS COUPLE APPEARED. It was so sudden that many people still didn’t believe that. But gradually, people began to accept this fact that Shen loved Zhang for years (a small joke, do not care. let me go on). As soon as possible, Shen ran away from our class - a place where was full of noise, and a student ran out with him (Yeah, you know, that was me). On the way to the Teachers’ Office, he hardly ever can calm down, and tried to make me trusted that he didn’t love Zhang at all. Certainly, I didn’t trust him. Then, he told me a great fact to show that he really hated Zhang. However, in my opinion, I thought it can show that he loved Zhang so much (I promised to him I will keep it to myself). </p><p>
                
                Their friendships are everywhere. When final exam finished, Ms. Chen needed 4 students to go with her and help her. She let Shen to decide who will go with her. Three people have been decided, only one place was left. When I thought I could go with them, Shen refused my request. But I wasn’t angry with him until I knew the final people is Zhang! I didn’t really trust he loved Zhang until today. And do you know what was his reason? He told me that he can’t stand that he should come but Zhang needn’t. Was that a real reason? Of course it was just an excuse. Now you can find that how sweet they are!</p><p>
                
                  Time flies quickly, but this couple never changed at once. Everyone trusted Shen loved Zhang from the heart. He can do anything if Zhang want (Zhang’s best friend Li was also very happy that She found a boyfriend in real, not in dream).</p><p>
                
                  Like Li, this final exam, Shen didn’t get a good mark. People from "Golden Triangle" also inferred that he was deliberate because he wanted to show how much he loved Zhang. He is waiting Zhang to catch him and go to the same high school. Then they could live together.</p><p>
                
                  Today, we all congratulated them, hope they can have happiness lives, Zhang and Shen are probably I know the sweetest. The meaning of the title History of Couples in Class 7 are between them. As a result, Shen is getting cleverer and cleverer with Zhang these days. That’s a change in the couples. That’s why we need to promote “Couple Culture”. That's also why it exists for so long.</p><p>
                
                (Shen Chenyu & Zhang Siyu)</p><h2>
                
                Forth Couple: Can middle-mark-students have sweet lives? The answer is “Yes!”</h2><p>
                
                  Boys always dreamed that they could live with a girl. Low-mark-students also dreamed about it. But can they have it? The students from class 7 give us an answer: Yes!</p><p>
                
                  Their friendship appeared in the third term, although it was short, it was a sweet experience. They had the same jobs in class (science section representative), so they did every work together. This made them became closer and closer. When he cannot come early, Jiang will seem to be angry, not only because of works, but also because Jiang miss he a lot.</p><p>
                
                  One day, on the way to home, Jiang told everyone who is go with her that she like passive person. Luckily, He is a quite and passive boy, and there is no one more passive than He. Is this an accident? Of course not! This showed us Jiang’s love for He. </p><p>
                
                  Evening self-study started in third term. After midterm exam, there were only 14 students per evening. Strangely, no couple studied together, except He and Jiang. So somebody thought that Jiang was deliberate. She came to study in order to He. This speculation was finally confirmed to be true.</p><p>
                
                  Near the final exam, student needed to clean all the classroom. What’s more, they always clean together. In the chat history of Jiang and my aunt, Jiang said that she wanted to express love to He, but she was afraid that He will refuse her. So she wanted He to express love to her.
                  In evening, Hong Yuzhe sometimes shared a piece of chocolate with Jiang. Jiang always shared this with He. But when He knew this piece of chocolate came from Hong, he stopped eating as quickly as possible.</p><p>
                
                  One day evening, Jiang has eaten dinner, and talked with her “best boyfriend”. The boy pinched Jiang’s face, by the way, he called her “small idiot”. Jiang momentary stunned. When she reacted, she chased him and hit him. Sadly, when all these things happened, He was behind them, and watched them play together.</p><p>
                
                  On the second last evening, Jiang design a sign about her. This sign and a birthday card were sent to He together. When He got this birthday gift, Jiang was standing behind him. She told he to tear of the sign. And she put her center of gravity backward. Then most of his hand covered her hand. Jiang was blushing quickly.</p><p>
                
                There is one more thing. When it was in class, they always looked at each other. After class, Jiang quickly went to visit He. All these things showed us this unbreakable couple and their enjoyable lives. Hope in the near future, we can see every old classmate on their wedding party!</p><p>
